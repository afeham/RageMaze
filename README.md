# RageMaze
First actual python game I made. (Nostaglia)

I made this a very long time ago, it's a maze game: nothing fancy. It's written in Python/Pygame. I don't recommend using it, but feel free to play around with it. I won't be accepting pull requests/updating it.

Yes, I know the code is bad, but hey, we all got to start somewhere, right? :P

P.S. This is also multiplayer and can support up to 2 players. One player will use the WASD keys and the other will use the up, down, left, right keys.
